        "text": "Many U.S. suburbs are seeing their populations grow as millennials move out of the city and head to the ‘burbs. Apex, N.C., a suburb of Raleigh, is the fastest-growing suburb in the U.S., according to realtor.com®. It has earned the nickname “Millennial Mayberry” as young adults flock to the town. Following several years of urban growth, the suburbs are proving the place to be. They now account for 14 of the 15 fastest-growing U.S. cities with populations of more than 50,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. “The back-to-the-city trend has reversed,” William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, told The Wall Street Journal. Millennials, especially those between the ages of 23 to 38 who may have been priced out of popular big cities, are now heading to suburbs like Frisco, Texas; Nolensville, Tenn.; Lakewood Ranch, Fla.; and Scottsdale, Ga., realtor.com® notes."
