        "text": "Oregon is joining a growing movement to loosen up single-family zoning laws in order to ramp up homebuilding. While several cities have passed similar bills, Oregon could be the first to offer state-level legislation. Oregon’s House and Senate have passed a measure to require cities with more than 10,000 people to allow duplexes in areas that have been zoned only for single-family homes. In Portland, cities and counties are required to also allow the building of quadplexes and “cottage clusters” of homes around a common yard. The state’s governor is expected to sign the bipartisan bill. “We all know we have a housing crisis,” Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek said in February. “We need multiple tools. One of them is to smooth and encourage additional construction.” A single-family home may be too pricey for some families, but duplexes and townhomes may offer greater affordability. “Every lot that is developed in the city that might be well-suited for townhomes or a duplex or a triplex that is instead developed this year with a single-family home—that was a missed opportunity,” Rep. Julie Fahey, who worked with Kotek on the bill, told Oregon Public Broadcasting.",
