        "text": "A recovering UK economy and increasing interest by both UK and overseas large institutional investors are key elements in the recent expansion of the PRS. Rising demand for professionally managed PRS accommodation has led to the emergence of large-scale owners aiming to offer a bespoke, professionally run service to a large and growing market. The build to rent sector has grown significantly in the last few years, in particular up to 2016, and the largest volume of BTR is coming through in urban city centres with London leading the way. There is also significant activity in Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Growth in the BTR sector has remained strong and there are positive forecasts over the next few years through to 2022 in volume and value terms of around 4-6% each year, reflecting a combination of rising house prices, stagnant wages and tighter mortgage lending, a shifting demographic balance – the growth of the so-called ‘Generation Rent‘, shifting behaviour amongst the younger age groups, population growth, net migration of mainly younger adults, and workforce mobility. The Government has looked to the build to rent sector as a way of easing the pressures of the national housing shortage.",
